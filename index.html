        <p class="white">Bees are the most important part of the game. (Quite literally says it in the game title.) And there's many types you can hatch! Firstly, there's a big variety of blue bees and red bees and they all serve different purposes. Depending on how many you have at your hive, you might want to prioritize their abilities at different colored fields. If you have many red bees you benefit a lot from red flowers/pollen. Same goes with white bees and blue bees. Each bee always have abilities that they give you depending on their rarity and what field they're in!</p>

        <p>Dandelion Field: You can find this right at spawn! This field should have big white dandelions to signify that it has primarily white pollen that you need to collect for quests. </p>
        <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bee-swarm-simulator/images/4/4d/BlueflowerField.png" width= "500px" Height= "250px"</img>
        <p class="blue"> Blue Flower Field: You can find this if you walk a little more around the map (if you haven't accessed other areas depending on the amount of bees you have) Be careful though, there's beetles that attack you so you need strong bees to fight them off. </p>
        <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bee-swarm-simulator/images/2/2f/RevisedCloverField.png" width= "500px" Height= "250px"</img>

        <p class="red"> Mushroom Field: This field is easily found because it has big red spotted mushrooms that you can see easily from spawn, when you spawn in the game, you can walk forward and it'll be right in front of you! </p>

        <p> Sunflower Field: This field is easily found right next to the Mushroom Field and the Dandelion Field, you can't neccessarily miss these fields when you first start the game. </p>

        <h3 class="big-header">Quests and NPC's</h3>
        <p class="white">There's many quests you can start around the map. When you first start the game you'll come across the first 3 bears (pictures below) until you unlock the new areas.
